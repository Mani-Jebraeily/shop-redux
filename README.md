># **Description**

This project is a simulated web application of an online store, developed using the React.js library. The aim of this project is to create an interactive and familiar user experience for visitors, allowing them to experience how a real online store operates. Users can search through various products, filter them based on different criteria, add desired products to the shopping cart and select their quantity. Finally, on the checkout page, users can view their order summary and complete a simulated purchase process by clicking the "Checkout" button.

* **Product Detail Page:** Each product has its own dedicated page with complete information including descriptions, more images, and detailed features.
* **Add to Cart:** Ability to add selected products to the shopping cart along with specifying the desired quantity.
* **Shopping Cart Management:** Ability to view the contents of the shopping cart, change the quantity of products, and remove them.
* **Checkout Page:** Displays a summary of the order including the list of products, quantity, unit price, and total price.
